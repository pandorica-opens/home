  * Developing snapR, a R package for single-nucleus ATAC-seq analysis (*in progress*).
  * Applied multiplexing single nucleus ATAC-seq to delineate cis-regulatory landscapes of constitute cell types in a frozen complex tissue (*Nature Neurosciences*).
  * Invented PLAC-seq (aka HiChIP) to map long-range chromatin interaction, improving the cost-efficiency by at least 10 fold compared to the previous method (*Cell Research*).
  * Developed CREST-seq, a titling deletion based CRISPR screening method to identify DNA regulatory elements, revealing enhancer elements for OCT4 (*Nature Methods*).
  * Applied convolutional neural networks to predict enhancer target genes.
