# About me
I am a Bioinforamtics PhD student in the laboratory of [Dr. Bing Ren](https://www.ludwigcancerresearch.org/location/san-diego-branch/bing-ren-lab). My research primarily foucuses on developing new techniques as well as computational methods to analyze the epigenomic heterogeneity of a complex tissue. I am currently working in the [BRAIN Initiative Project](https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/) to generate a spatially resolved single-cell epigenome atlas of the adult mouse brain. I am also an amateur distant runner.
