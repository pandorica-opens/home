# Biography

I am a Bioinforamtics PhD student in the lab of [Dr. Bing Ren](https://www.ludwigcancerresearch.org/location/san-diego-branch/bing-ren-lab). My research primarily foucuses on developing new techniques and computational methods to analyze the heterogenity of regulatory programs in a complex tissue at the level of single cell. I am currently working in [BRAIN Initiative](https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/) to generate a spatially resolved single-cell epigenome atlas of adult mouse brain. I am also interested in genome orgnaization and enhancer function, fancinated by the question how nearly 2-meter long genome fits into a tiny nucleus.
