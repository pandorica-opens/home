# About me
I am a Bioinforamtics PhD student in the laboratory of [Dr. Bing Ren](https://www.ludwigcancerresearch.org/location/san-diego-branch/bing-ren-lab). My research primarily foucuses on developing new techniques and computational methods to analyze the epigenomic heterogeneity of complex tissue. I am currently working as a part of [BRAIN Initiative Project](https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/) to generate a single-cell epigenome atlas of mouse brain. Outside science, I am an amateur distant runner.
