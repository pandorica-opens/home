# About me
I am a Bioinforamtics PhD student in the laboratory of [Dr. Bing Ren](https://www.ludwigcancerresearch.org/location/san-diego-branch/bing-ren-lab). My research primarily foucuses on developing new techniques and computational methods to understand gene regulation at the level of single cell. As a part of [BRAIN Initiative Project](https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/), I am currently working on constructing a spatially resolved single-cell atlas of mouse brain.
