abstract = "We report a highly sensitive and cost-effective method for genome-wide identification of chromatin interactions in eukaryotic cells. Combining proximity ligation with chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing, the method outperforms the state of art approach in sensitivity, accuracy and ease of operation. Application of the method to mouse embryonic stem cells improves mapping of enhancer promoter interactions. "
