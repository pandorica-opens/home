Here, we systematically investigated the effects of 50 million variations from five strains of mice on mRNA, nascent transcription, transcription start sites, and transcription factor binding in resting and activated macrophages. We observed substantial differences associated with distinct molecular pathways. Evaluating genetic variation provided evidence for roles of âˆ¼100 TFs in shaping lineage-determining factor binding. Unexpectedly, a substantial fraction of strain-specific factor binding could not be explained by local mutations. Integration of genomic features with chromatin interaction data provided evidence for hundreds of connected cis-regulatory domains associated with differences in transcription factor binding and gene expression. This system and the 250 datasets establish a substantial new resource for investigation of how genetic variation affects cellular phenotypes.","tags":[],"title":"Analysis of Genetically Diverse Macrophages Reveals Local and Domain-wide Mechanisms that Control Transcription Factor Binding and Function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Preissl\\*, **Rongxin Fang**\\*, Hui Huang, Yuan Zhao, Ramya Raviram, David U.

Here we report single-nucleus ATAC-seq, a combinatorial barcoding-assisted single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin that is optimized for use on flash-frozen primary tissue samples. We apply this technique to the mouse forebrain through eight developmental stages. Through analysis of more than 15,000 nuclei, we identify 20 distinct cell populations corresponding to major neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. We further define cell-type-specific transcriptional regulatory sequences, infer potential master transcriptional regulators and delineate developmental changes in forebrain cellular composition. Our results provide insight into the molecular and cellular dynamics that underlie forebrain development in the mouse and establish technical and analytical frameworks that are broadly applicable to other heterogeneous tissues.","tags":[],"title":"Single-nucleus analysis of accessible chromatin in developing mouse forebrain reveals cell-type-specific transcriptional regulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yarui Diao\\*, **Rongxin Fang\\***, Bin Li\\*, Zhipeng Meng, Juntao Yu, Yunjiang Qiu, Kimberly C Lin, Hui Huang, Tristin Liu, Ryan J Marina, Inkyung Jung, Yin Shen, Kun-Liang Guan \u0026 Bing Ren (*equal contribution)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1492412400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1492412400,"objectID":"1c0726a4f6d803da92abba7d54e76011","permalink":"https://r3fang.github.io/rongxin/publication/crest-seq/","publishdate":"2017-04-17T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/rongxin/publication/crest-seq/","section":"publication","summary":"Millions of cis-regulatory elements are predicted to be present in the human genome, but direct evidence for their biological function is scarce. Here we report a high-throughput method, cis-regulatory element scan by tiling-deletion and sequencing (CREST-seq), for the unbiased discovery and functional assessment of cis-regulatory sequences in the genome. We used it to interrogate the 2-Mb POU5F1 locus in human embryonic stem cells, and identified 45 cis-regulatory elements. A majority of these elements have active chromatin marks, DNase hypersensitivity, and occupancy by multiple transcription factors, which confirms the utility of chromatin signatures in cis-element mapping. Notably, 17 of them are previously annotated promoters of functionally unrelated genes, and like typical enhancers, they form extensive spatial contacts with the POU5F1 promoter. These results point to the commonality of enhancer-like promoters in the human genome.","tags":[],"title":"A tiling-deletion-based genetic screen for cis-regulatory element identification in mammalian cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Rongxin Fang**\\*, Miao Yu\\*, Guoqiang Li, Sora Chee, Tristin Liu, Anthony D Schmitt \u0026 Bing Ren (*equal contribution)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1467356400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467356400,"objectID":"70a51fb08952538b810c5bddc9e7cf98","permalink":"https://r3fang.github.io/rongxin/publication/plac-seq/","publishdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/rongxin/publication/plac-seq/","section":"publication","summary":"We report a highly sensitive and cost-effective method for genome-wide identification of chromatin interactions in eukaryotic cells.

However, the definitive characteristics of the CTCF binding motif required for its functional diversity still remains elusive. Here, we describe a new motif discovery workflow by which we have identified three CTCF binding motif variations with highly divergent functionalities. Supported by transcriptomic, epigenomic and chromatin-interactomic data, we show that the functional diversity of the CTCF binding motifs is strongly associated with their GC content, CpG dinucleotide coverage and relative DNA methylation level at the 12th position of the motifs. Further analysis suggested that the co-localization of cohesin, the key factor in cohesion of sister chromatids, is negatively correlated with the CpG coverage and the relative DNA methylation level at the 12th position. Finally, we present evidences for a hypothetical model in which chromatin interactions between promoters and distal regulatory regions are likely mediated by CTCFs binding to sequences with high CpG..","tags":[],"title":"Functional diversity of CTCFs is encoded in their binding motifs","type":"publication"}]
